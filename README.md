# Fruits Search Project - JavaScript Autofill Search Bar

Welcome to the Fruits Search Project! In this project, you will create a JavaScript-powered Autofill Search Bar for various types of fruit. This is a valuable skill to have as a front-end engineer, as it is a common task when building websites and applications.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a small-scale search bar that suggests various fruits based on user input. We will provide you with a list of fruits and a mock-up of how the page should look. Your task is to implement the functionality of the search bar using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

When a user types input that matches any part of a fruit's name in the provided list, a dropdown menu will appear containing all the matching fruits. As the user continues to type, the dropdown menu will update to show relevant suggestions. When a user clicks on one of the options, it will populate the search bar.

## Features
### Autofill:
 As the user types, the search bar will display a list of fruit suggestions based on the input. The suggestions will update dynamically as the user types.
Dropdown Menu: The search bar will include a dropdown menu containing the list of matching fruits. When a user clicks on a suggestion, it will populate the search bar.
Responsive Design: The search bar and dropdown menu should adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensure that the search bar works properly on various browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
